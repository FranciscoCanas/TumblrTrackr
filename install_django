1) Download latest version from https://www.djangoproject.com/download/. 

2) Save to a folder somewhere.

Now do the following in a console with black bacground and green fonts, so it looks like you're hacking the matrix an' shit.

3) Open console, go to folder, type: 
tar xzvf Django-1.4.3

4) Go: cd Django-1.4.3
type: python setup.py install --user

5) Now go to your home folder and add the django binary path to your PATH:
cd ~
gedit .cshrc &
setenv PATH $HOME/<Path to your django>/Django-1.4.3/django/django/bin:$PATH

NO TYPOS!

6) Save, exit, restart a terminal, then type:
django-admin.py --version
If you get 1.4.3 or some such thing, you're sittin' pretty and can move to this tutorial:

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial01/

If that didn't work, you probably set your PATH wrong. Ask Sasa to fix it for you.

Done.
