1) Download latest version from https://www.djangoproject.com/download/. 

2) Save to a folder somewhere.

Now do the following in a console with black background and green fonts, so it looks like you're hacking the matrix an' shit.

3) Open console, go to folder, type: 
tar xzvf Django-1.4.3

4) Go: cd Django-1.4.3
type: python setup.py install --user

5) Now go to your home folder and add the django binary path to your PATH:
cd ~
gedit .cshrc &
setenv PATH $HOME/<Path to your django>/Django-1.4.3/django/django/bin:$PATH

NO TYPOS!

6) Save, exit, restart a terminal, then type:
django-admin.py --version
If you get 1.4.3 or some such thing, you're sittin' pretty and can move to this tutorial:

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial01/

If that didn't work, you probably set your PATH wrong. Ask Sasa to fix it for you.

Done.

### Installing Requests: HTTP for humans ###
1) Go to your root CSC309 folder, or somewhere else safe.
2) Type: curl -OL https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/tarball/master
3) Once the file has downloaded, type: tar -xvf master
4) Once the file has extracted, type: cd kennethreitz-requests-13de692/
5) Install it with: python setup.py install --user

Now go to some arbitrary folder, start python's interpreter, and try to 'import requests' to make sure it works... should be set.

########## How to use REQUESTS from the command line:
Open up python interpreter.
import requests
r=requests.get('http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/artgalleryofontario.tumblr.com/likes?api_key=
        UVsuuWUK99CX70DXIKylXXoCVo1QPvYzYPxKzN0GLTVxyd26bx')
j=r.json()
j['meta'] # The meta response info
j['response'] # The actual response
j['response']['liked_posts'] # the list of liked posts
j['response']['liked_posts'][0] # The first post json object
j['response']['liked_posts'][0]['post_url'] # The first post's json's post url 

# This one gets a specific post from artgalleryofontario.tumblr.com w/ id 23:
r=requests.get('http://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/artgalleryofontario.tumblr.com/posts?api_key=
        UVsuuWUK99CX70DXIKylXXoCVo1QPvYzYPxKzN0GLTVxyd26bx&id=23')
